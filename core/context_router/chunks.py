chunks.py — the ContextChunk model.

A ContextChunk is one retrievable unit of stored memory/knowledge. Chunks
carry their own extracted terms/phrases/identifiers so the index can be built
once and queries scored fast. Call ``ContextChunk.from_text`` to build a chunk
with automatic extraction.

In production the router is always instantiated with chunks loaded from the
live LTM store (see core/memory_store/store.py). The seed corpus below is kept
for standalone testing and the experiments/context_router CLI.
