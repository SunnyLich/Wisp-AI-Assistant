"""
core.macos_helper.stt_client — parent-side STT shim.

Mirrors the public surface of ``core.stt`` (prewarm / start_recording /
stop_and_transcribe) but forwards each call to the worker process. ``core.stt``
delegates here when the macOS helper is enabled, so callers (main.py's voice
path) are unchanged.

Failures degrade gracefully rather than crashing the hotkey/voice threads: a
broken worker means "no transcript" (""), not an exception propagating onto a
daemon thread.
