"""
wisp_brain.protocol — newline-delimited JSON framing for the Python worker seam.

One JSON object per line, UTF-8, terminated by ``\\n``. Message shapes:

  request   {"id": int, "method": str, "params": {...}}          # host  -> brain
  response  {"id": int, "ok": bool, "result": <any> | "error": str}  # brain -> host
  event     {"event": str, "id": int|null, "data": <any>}        # brain -> host

The framing is intentionally identical to ``core.macos_helper.protocol`` so the
two transports stay interchangeable and the existing IPC tests carry over. The
one superset is the optional ``id`` on events: a streaming method (e.g.
``brain.query``) tags every ``reply.chunk`` event with the originating request
id so the host can route partial output to the right in-flight call. Events with
``id == null`` are broadcast/unsolicited (lifecycle, logs).

Large binary payloads (PCM audio) must NOT be base64'd through here on the hot
path. Audio paths cross process boundaries; only *paths* cross
this channel; if a streaming binary frame is ever needed it gets its own
length-prefixed type rather than bloating the JSON line protocol.
