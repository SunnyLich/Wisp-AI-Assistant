# Wisp

**A local-first desktop AI assistant that lives where you work.**

Press a hotkey, choose an intent, and Wisp captures the right context, streams the answer into a small overlay, and can read it aloud while you stay in the current app.

## What Wisp Does

Wisp is for the moments when opening a chat app would break your flow.

Highlight text, press `Ctrl+Q`, hit one intent key, and Wisp asks your configured model with only the context sources you enabled. Replies stream into a compact bubble next to the floating icon. If TTS is enabled, the answer is spoken as it arrives.

| Instead of... | Wisp lets you... |
| --- | --- |
| Copying text into a separate chat window | Ask from the app you are already using |
| Rewriting the same prompts again and again | Bind prompts to hotkeys and intent rows |
| Reading long responses every time | Hear the answer through streaming TTS |
| Explaining what is on screen manually | Capture selection, clipboard, documents, browser pages, and screen snippets |
| Trusting a remote assistant with storage | Keep memory and configuration on your machine |

## Highlights

- **Overlay first** - a floating icon, intent picker, and reply bubble stay on top without taking over your desktop.
- **Privacy by default** - Wisp has no hosted storage layer; data stays on your machine unless you send it to your chosen model, and privacy mode can warn or redact before sensitive context leaves.
- **Highly customizable** - every hotkey, intent key, prompt, context source, paste-back behavior, model route, voice setting, and bubble dimension can be changed.
- **Approachable GUI** - Settings, setup checks, privacy reports, memory tools, and model warnings explain what is happening without requiring you to read the code.
- **Context capture** - Wisp can read selected text, clipboard text, focused UI, open documents, browser content, recent files, and optional screenshots.
- **Voice in and out** - local STT via faster-whisper, plus Cartesia, ElevenLabs, OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible, or disabled TTS.
- **Vision snips** - draw a region with `Ctrl+Alt+Q` and send the screenshot to a vision model.
- **Rewrite and paste** - use `Ctrl+Shift+Q` to rewrite selected text and paste the result back into the active field.
- **Bring your own provider** - Groq, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Mistral, XAI, Together, Cerebras, custom OpenAI-compatible servers, GitHub Copilot, and more.
- **Local memory** - optional short-term and long-term memory are stored locally, with a viewer for editing or deleting facts.
- **Addons** - extend Wisp with hooks, tray actions, settings, model-callable tools, intents, and hotkeys.
- **Agent tasks** - a sandboxed task framework exists for longer jobs that need decomposition, review, and artifacts.

## Workflow

```text
highlight text, choose context, or draw a snip
  -> press the caller hotkey
  -> Wisp captures only the selected or enabled context
  -> pick an intent or type a custom prompt
  -> send directly to your configured model provider
  -> stream model reply
  -> show bubble + optional TTS
  -> optionally store useful memory locally
```

Example flows:

| Moment | Action | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| You want an explanation of selected text | Highlight the text, press `Ctrl+Q`, then choose `W` (`What is this?`) or `A` (`Explain simply`) | Wisp explains the selection in the overlay |
| You want to rewrite a sentence | Highlight the sentence first, press `Ctrl+Shift+Q`, then choose `W`, `A`, or `D` for grammar, simplification, or tone | Wisp rewrites the selected text and can paste it back |
| You need to ask your own question | Press `Ctrl+Q`, press `S`, type the prompt, then press Enter | Wisp sends your custom prompt with whatever context is enabled for that caller |
| A UI element or image is confusing | Press `Ctrl+Alt+Q`, draw a box, then choose an intent or custom prompt | Wisp sends the snip to a vision model |
| You want to ask the model by voice | Hold `F9`, speak, then release | Wisp transcribes your voice and sends it as a model query |
| You want to dictate into another app | Hold `F8`, speak, then release | Wisp transcribes your speech directly into the focused text field |

## Quick Start

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SunnyLich/Python-AI-assistant-overlay.git
cd Python-AI-assistant-overlay
```

Then launch with the script for your platform:

| OS | Launcher | Dependency source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | `Start Wisp.bat` | `requirements.txt` |
| macOS | `Start Wisp.command` | `requirements-macos.lock` |
| Linux | `Start Wisp.sh` | `requirements.txt` |

The first launch provisions the Python environment and installs dependencies. Later launches go straight into the app.

Requirements:

- Python `3.12.13` exactly, pinned in `.python-version`
- Windows 10/11, macOS 13+, or Linux with X11 for the full hotkey/screenshot path
- At least one configured LLM provider key or local compatible server

For full runtime logs, use the matching debug launcher:

```text
Start Wisp Debug.bat
Start Wisp Debug.command
Start Wisp Debug.sh
```

## Configuration

Use the Settings window for normal setup. It can store provider keys, choose model routes, configure voice, run a setup check, explain missing optional features, and show warnings for unsupported model capabilities.

For source builds and advanced setups, `.env.example` documents the available configuration keys. You usually do not need to edit those by hand.

## Default Hotkeys

| Hotkey | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Open the general intent picker |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Q` | Open the rewrite/paste intent picker |
| `Ctrl+Alt+Q` | Draw a screen snip for vision |
| `Alt+Q` | Add the current selection to the context buffer |
| `Alt+W` | Clear the context buffer |
| `F9` hold | Record voice, transcribe, and query |
| `F8` hold | Direct dictation into the focused text field |
| `W` / `A` / `D` | Trigger built-in intent rows |
| `S` | Custom prompt mode |
| `Esc` | Cancel the picker |

Every caller, hotkey, label, prompt, context source, paste-back setting, and UI dimension is configurable from Settings.

## Privacy And Control

Wisp is designed as a local desktop assistant. Storage stays on your machine, and requests go directly to the model provider or local server you configure.

- Local data stays local: settings, chats, memory, privacy reports, and configuration are stored on your machine.
- Model requests go straight from your machine to the provider or local server you configured.
- Your configured model provider receives only the prompt you send and the context sources selected or enabled for that caller.
- Wisp may inspect available context locally to show token estimates, availability, and privacy redaction counts before you send. Previewing a source does not send it to the model provider or save it as chat/memory.
- Context is controlled per hotkey profile: ambient app context, clipboard, documents, browser pages, GitHub context, memory, tools, and screenshots can each be enabled, disabled, or routed on demand.
- Privacy mode keeps privacy-first setup checks and warning behavior enabled, including redaction status before sensitive context is sent.
- Optional voice, document reading, browser content, screenshots, GitHub Copilot, and addons stay inactive until configured.
- Cloud TTS, model providers, compatible servers, or GitHub Copilot are contacted only when you configure and use those features.
- Addons run in isolated Python host processes and must declare the capabilities they need.
- Setup checks avoid importing heavy provider, audio, or STT stacks unless the feature is enabled.

## Platform Status

| Platform | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Windows 11 | Full support |
| Windows 10 | Supported |
| macOS 13+ | Supported with native/audio work isolated in workers |
| Linux X11 | Functional |
| Linux Wayland | Limited; use X11 for the full hotkey/screenshot path |

## Feedback And Platform Help

Bug reports are welcome, especially for desktop behaviors that depend on OS permissions, window managers, audio devices, or display servers. If you hit a crash, missing permission, broken hotkey, capture issue, paste-back failure, or setup-check warning that looks wrong, please open an issue with your OS version, launcher, logs, and the action that triggered it.

Help testing and improving macOS support and Linux Wayland support is especially useful. These platforms have the most native integration edge cases, so real-world reports from different machines, desktop environments, and permission states make Wisp better for everyone.
