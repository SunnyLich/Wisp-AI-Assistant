# Wisp Code Overview

Wisp is a desktop assistant with one Python application architecture across
Windows, macOS, and Linux. The shared pure-Python supervisor splits UI, native
OS work, audio, and brain/model work into isolated worker processes.

## Top-Level Layout

- `macos_py/supervisor/` wires the application together: worker lifecycle,
  hotkeys, context buffering, memory, intent flow, chat windows, and voice/snip
  interactions.
- `main.py` is the legacy single-process Qt entrypoint kept temporarily while
  the supervisor path becomes the only app runtime.
- `config.py` loads runtime configuration from `.env` and keychain-backed
  secrets.
- `core/` contains service and integration code: LLM routing, audio, TTS/STT,
  capture, context fetching, memory, auth, tool discovery, and agent execution.
- `core/system/` defines canonical paths, platform setup, and environment-file
  helpers.
- `core/agent/` contains the serializable agent task contract, runner runtime
  primitives, and scoped agent execution.
- `core/auth/` contains provider authentication helpers for ChatGPT, GitHub, and
  Copilot.
- `core/llm_clients/` contains the streaming LLM client and fallback route
  parsing for LLM requests.
- `core/memory_store/` contains memory storage and explicit memory-command
  parsing.
- `ui/` contains Qt widgets and dialogs: the icon overlay, chat window,
  settings, intent picker, snip overlay, memory viewer, and agent task UI.
- `ui/agent/`, `ui/settings_panel/`, and `ui/shared/` group the largest UI
  domains and shared widget helpers.
- Root-level modules such as `core.llm`, `core.agent_runner`, `ui.settings`, and
  `ui.agent_task_mockup` are compatibility aliases for older imports.
- `tools/installed/` is the local script-tool plugin directory discovered by
  `core.tool_registry`.
- `tests/` covers parser helpers, config/settings behavior, model route
  fallback logic, tool discovery, secret storage, TTS config, macOS worker
  boundaries, and the agent runner.
- `macos_py/` contains the pure-Python supervisor, worker processes, and the
  headless brain package used by the app.

## Plugin Contract

Plugins belong in the shared Python plugin/runtime layer: Python packages under
`plugins/<name>/__init__.py` and local script tools under `tools/installed/`.
Both Windows and macOS discover the same plugin metadata, hooks, tray actions,
and model-callable tools from that shared layer. Plugin-specific business logic,
provider calls, hooks, tools, and future custom plugin behavior stay in Python
so a plugin does not need separate Windows and macOS implementations.

## Runtime Flow

1. `macos_py.supervisor` starts the UI, native, audio, and brain workers, then
   registers platform hotkeys through the native worker.
2. A caller hotkey captures selected text or a screen snippet, then opens the
   intent picker.
3. The selected intent builds a prompt with optional ambient context, documents,
   tool access, memory retrieval, and screenshots.
4. `core.llm` routes the request to the configured provider with fallback
   routes where enabled.
5. Reply chunks feed the overlay/chat UI and TTS stream while memory receives
   the completed exchange.

## Quality Notes

- `core.system.env_utils` centralizes env-file IO and typed environment parsing. Prefer
  it over ad hoc `int(os.getenv(...))` and string-only boolean checks.
- Keep shared contracts and pure helpers in `core/`; keep PyQt object creation,
  signal wiring, and widget layout in `ui/`.
- The largest extraction candidates are `core/agent_runner.py`,
  `ui/agent_task_mockup.py`, `ui/settings.py`, `core/llm.py`, and
  `core/context_fetcher.py`. Split these only around stable boundaries such as data
  models, provider adapters, view components, and pure parsers.
- Keep UI modules responsible for presentation and user interaction; move pure
  parsing, formatting, and persistence helpers into `core/` or small UI helper
  modules with tests.
- Configuration changes should include a settings test and a reload test when
  the value can be changed at runtime.
