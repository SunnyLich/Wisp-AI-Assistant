# Assistant UX Feature Plan

This plan covers the next user-trust and recoverability work for Wisp. It is
intentionally scoped to features 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8 from the product notes.

## Goals

- Make setup confidence visible instead of implicit.
- Make runtime health and failures understandable from the overlay.
- Make model-bound context inspectable before sending.
- Make voice input correctable before it changes a field or fires a query.
- Make privacy redaction visible as "detected and censored" evidence.
- Keep every new user-visible string covered by all Qt locale files:
  `ui/locales/qt/wisp_es.ts`, `ui/locales/qt/wisp_fr.ts`,
  `ui/locales/qt/wisp_zh.ts`, and `ui/locales/qt/wisp_zh-Hant.ts`.

## 1. First-Run Calibration

Entry point:

- Add a Settings button in a diagnostics/setup section, such as "Run setup
  check".
- The button opens a reusable calibration wizard, not a one-time-only dialog.
- Store completion state with a setting such as `WISP_SETUP_COMPLETED=true` so
  Wisp can suggest the check once while still keeping it available.

Checks:

- LLM provider and model can answer a cheap test request.
- TTS provider can synthesize and play a short sample.
- STT can hear microphone input and return a transcript.
- Global hotkeys are registered.
- Context capture permissions work.
- Screenshot/snip permissions work.

Tests:

- Settings exposes the setup check button without importing audio/STT stacks.
- Calibration reports pass, fail, and skipped states with recommendations.
- Settings Apply/reload preserves setup-completed state.
- New labels and statuses are present in every locale file.

## 2. Status and Health Panel

Entry point:

- Add a right-click menu item named "Health Status".
- Opening it shows a compact health window.
- Important problems can also show as a small dismissible notice near the Wisp icon.

Health window content:

- Hotkeys active/inactive.
- Current LLM provider and model.
- TTS provider status.
- STT ready, warming, skipped, or failed.
- Context sources enabled.
- Last serious error and recommendation.

Near-icon notices:

- No LLM provider configured.
- Hotkeys failed or conflict.
- Microphone permission missing.
- Screenshot permission missing.
- TTS returned no audio.

Dismissal behavior:

- Dismissed notices stay quiet until the status changes or the app restarts.

Tests:

- Right-click menu exposes the health status action.
- Health window renders degraded states without crashing.
- Near-icon notices are dismissible and reappear when status changes.
- All health strings are translated.

## 3. Context Preview

Surfaces:

- Implement in the intent overlay.
- Implement in the chat window.
- Use a shared context-preview data model so both surfaces agree.

Preview content:

- Selected text detected.
- Clipboard text detected when enabled.
- Browser/page context detected.
- Active document or dropped document context.
- Screenshot context.
- Memory count.
- Addon/tool context.
- Privacy redaction count when available.

User controls:

- Show a compact expandable preview before send.
- Allow removing context items where the current flow can safely support it.
- After response, optionally show a footer like "Used selection + browser tab +
  2 memories".

Tests:

- Intent overlay requests and renders context preview chips.
- Chat window requests and renders the same context preview shape.
- Disabled sources do not leak into prompts.
- Redaction counts appear when privacy redaction changes context.
- New preview strings are translated.

## 6. Voice Transcript Correction

Behavior:

- After voice capture, show a small candidate window near the typed target when
  native focus geometry is available.
- Fall back to placing the window near the Wisp icon.
- For assistant voice input, show the candidate window near the overlay or
  reply bubble.

Candidate actions:

- Use the top result with Enter.
- Click an alternate candidate.
- Edit manually.
- Cancel.

Candidate generation:

- Faster-whisper does not cheaply expose true top-N complete transcript
  alternatives in the current path.
- Extra STT alternatives would likely require slower extra decoding passes, so
  that should be an optional later setting.
- First implementation should show the raw transcript plus cheap cleanup
  variants, such as punctuated text and a command-shaped version when LLM
  cleanup mode is enabled.

Tests:

- Dictation does not paste until a candidate is accepted in confirm mode.
- Assistant voice query does not fire until a candidate is accepted in confirm
  mode.
- Cancel leaves the focused field unchanged.
- Candidate fallback placement works when native geometry is unavailable.
- Candidate popup strings are translated.

## 7. Privacy Detection and Censoring Report

Behavior:

- Privacy mode should show what Wisp detected and censored, not only that
  privacy is enabled.
- Redaction must happen before text is sent to a model.

Report content:

- Detected categories such as API keys, bearer tokens, passwords, emails, phone
  numbers, file paths, and other configured sensitive patterns.
- Redacted previews that do not reveal the full secret, such as
  `sk-...abcd`.
- Count of redacted items per context source.

Surfaces:

- Context preview shows a badge such as "3 items redacted".
- Clicking the badge opens the privacy report.
- Health/status can include privacy configuration warnings if redaction is off.

Settings:

- Enable or disable redaction.
- Strict mode.
- Category toggles where practical.

Tests:

- Prompt-bound context contains redacted values, not raw secrets.
- Privacy report shows detected categories and safe previews.
- Context preview surfaces the redaction count.
- Turning privacy off is explicit and visible.
- New privacy strings are translated.

## 8. Error Recommendations

Behavior:

- User-facing errors should include the recommendation directly after the message.
- Keep technical detail available for diagnostics, but do not make it the first
  thing users see.

Error shape:

- Message.
- Recommendation.
- Technical detail.
- Optional action button.

Initial recommendation coverage:

- Missing API key.
- Invalid provider or model.
- Provider timeout or network failure.
- TTS provider returned no audio.
- STT import, model download, or microphone failure.
- Hotkey registration conflict.
- Screenshot or screen-recording permission failure.
- Addon crash.

Tests:

- Common errors format as message plus recommendation.
- Health panel and near-icon notices use the same recommendation text.
- Secrets are redacted from technical details.
- New error strings and action labels are translated.

## Implementation Order

1. Error recommendations.
2. Health panel and right-click menu entry.
3. Setup check button and calibration wizard in Settings.
4. Shared context preview for intent overlay and chat window.
5. Privacy detection and censoring report.
6. Voice transcript correction popup.

## Workflow Test Gate

The app workflow runner should keep this plan visible in its run summary, and
the workflow test suite should include a contract test that checks every planned
feature remains documented with tests and translation coverage.
